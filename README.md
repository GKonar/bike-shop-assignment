## About an app

- other packages

App is responsive

## Quick start  

1. Clone it.

2. Run **npm install** in Your terminal.

3. Run **npm start** which runs app in development mode.

4. Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

**npm start** command will run app and fake json server ( [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)) created to simulate async communication.

  

All data which is on server is in **db.json** file and it is available here:

http://localhost:3000/bikes

I've used some ready components from Material UI framework [https://material-ui.com/](https://material-ui.com/) and also MaterialUI's stying solution ( JSS ) .
