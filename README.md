## Simple bike-shop app. Created with [Create React App]([https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).
### App is build in ReactJS ver. 16.12.0
## To run the app:

1.  Clone it.
    
2.  Run **npm install** in Your terminal.
    
3.  Run **npm start** which runs app in development mode.
    
4.  Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**npm start** command will run app and fake json server ( [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)) created to simulate async communication.

All data which is on server is in **db.json** file and it is available here:
http://localhost:3000/bikes
http://localhost:3000/faq

 
I've used some ready components from Material UI framework [https://material-ui.com/](https://material-ui.com/)  and also MaterialUI's stying solution ( JSS ) .
